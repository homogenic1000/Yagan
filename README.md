# What is Yagan ?

Yagan is a mobile app that allows train passengers to report and track various aspects of their journey. Users can report ticket inspectors, the status of facilities (e.g., if toilets are out of order), crowd density within the train, and more. The app is community-based, with reports coming from users to keep everyone informed in real-time.

## Features
- Journey Search: Enter your departure and arrival points to view available trains.
	•	Reporting: Report issues such as ticket inspectors, toilets out of service, or high crowd density in the train.
	•	My Trips: Save your trips and receive notifications of new reports related to those trips.
	•	Real-Time Tracking: View live information about ticket inspectors, facilities, and crowd density on trains.
		Community-Based: Reports are made by users, helping the community stay informed and up-to-date.
